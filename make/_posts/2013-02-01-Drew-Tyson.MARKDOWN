<p>Local photographer Drew Tyson approached me with the frustration of trying to find a portfolio site that was simple and intuitive enough to put his photography and business first. Whether in the field on a mobile device or in the office on a desktop, this site provides a user experience that allows no distraction from Tyson's photography.</p>
